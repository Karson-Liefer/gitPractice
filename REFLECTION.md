1. The package.json is the the file that lists everything your project needs to function. While the node_modules folder is where the actual code for those external libraries is.
2. The ${} syntax acts as a placeholder that lets you switch from plain text too javaScript code. It is useful because it is less messy and you can put more than just variables inside the brackets.
3. When I saved my code it did auto-format and I saw a couple errors that I was able to fix.
4. I made 3 commits this assignment. The reason its better to make multiple smaller commits is because its easier for debugging and makes reviewing code easier. 
5. We const for a lot of things, it tells anyone reading your code that the value will not be reassigned. We use let when you know that a values variable needs to changed later on. We use var to declare variables.
